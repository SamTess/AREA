# 🌍 Terraform Infrastructure Guide

Build your cloud foundation with Terraform! This guide helps you automate and manage your AREA infrastructure with ease and repeatability.

## 🏗️ Structure
- `main.tf`: The blueprint for your cloud resources.
- `variables.tf`: Define your custom settings and secrets (never commit secrets!).
- `terraform.example.tfvars`: Example variable file—copy and fill in your own values.

## 🚀 Usage
1. Copy `terraform.example.tfvars` to `terraform.tfvars` and fill in your values.
2. Initialize Terraform:
   ```zsh
   terraform init
   ```
3. Apply your infrastructure changes:
   ```zsh
   terraform apply
   ```
4. Destroy resources when you need a clean slate:
   ```zsh
   terraform destroy
   ```

## 💡 Tips
- Never commit secrets or cloud credentials.
- Use remote state for team deployments.
- Always review the plan before applying changes.

Automate, scale, and manage your cloud with confidence! 🌍🚀

# 🐳 Docker Deployment Guide

Containerize your AREA project and run it anywhere! Docker Compose and Nginx make it easy to launch, scale, and secure your services. Let's get started!

## 📦 Structure
- `docker-compose.yml`: The main file to orchestrate your containers.
- `.env.example`: Template for environment variables—copy, fill, and keep secrets out of git!
- `nginx.conf`: Nginx config for SSL, routing, and security.

## 🚀 Usage
1. Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and fill in required values.
2. Start your services:
   ```zsh
   docker-compose up -d
   ```
3. Check logs to see what's happening:
   ```zsh
   docker-compose logs
   ```
4. Stop everything when you're done:
   ```zsh
   docker-compose down
   ```

## 💡 Tips
- Never commit `.env` with secrets.
- Use Nginx for SSL termination and rate limiting.
- Update images regularly for security.

Deploy, scale, and relax—Docker's got your back! 🐳✨
